# RPK (Reference Platform for Kubernetes)

## Project Motivation

- [Quick Overview](docs/OVERVIEW.md)
- [Architecture Guide](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)

## License

RPK (Reference Platform for Kubernetes), formerly referred to as "Project Ivy", is a VMware project that is developed and open sourced under the MIT License.  View the [license file](./LICENSE) and [notice file](./NOTICE) in this repo for more information.

### Disclaimer

- RPK is intended to represent a reference implementation of what a modern application platform **could** look like.  There
are several other decisions that go into making an application platform "production ready".  RPK is not intended to produce a
production ready application platform, rather give an opinionated, sample view of what one may look like.

- RPK is not supported by VMware.  It is a tool that belongs to Tanzu Labs and is intended to be used by
those who wish to get acquainted with Kubernetes and the decisions that go into producing a fully fledged application platform.
Once again, the platform produced by RPK is a reference only and not intended to be production ready out of the box.
